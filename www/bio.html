<h1>Cool Quircky Things About Me</h1>
<p>I have a shrine to Robert Boerwinkle in my room. I have exactly 4 quarts of coffee in my dorm. I have forgotten to bring my trashcan to campus more than three times this year and have had to use what I dub as a "trash pile" instead since the begining of this year.</p>
